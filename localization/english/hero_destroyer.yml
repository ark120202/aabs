The destroyer was worshiped by the lower beings of the nearby worlds, which always amused him. One day, korotaya his eternal and carefree life in one of them, Kronshak felt wrong - something vicious and bloodthirsty invaded his domain. However, he came too late - Stegius, an ancient and powerful demon who escaped from Desolus, destroyed the native world of Kronshak to the ground. None of the divine Pantheon could not withstand it: everything happened lightning fast. After casting a menacing glance at the smoking ruins of his dimension, Kronshak vowed to stop the monster at any cost. Pulling out the Collum of Crush from the ruins of the Pantheon, he laid it on his shoulder and followed the trail of Stegius. The demon did not go far - Kronshak found it when he destroyed the fourth dimension, one of the worlds in submission to God. After a short struggle, Stegius retreated, however, before he escaped into another world, the Destroyer Kronshak imposed a seal on Ash-Lagor on the demon, sealing the demon where he had fled - in the world of Allden. The seal deprived the demon of his former destructive power. The people of Allden could overcome the weakened demon and sealed it deep underground. But, even despite his victory, Kronshak was depressed and broken, like his world. His spirit is weakened. He fell into stasis for many millennia, waiting for the Universe to once again need to stop the Master of Death. It is not known how long he slept when there was a split that awakened him. The router felt that Stegius had escaped from his prison. Following his old oath, he followed him and got to the Arena of the Angels, where he was to clash in a bloody battle, not only with Stegius, but with all the other creatures of Chaos, depressing many worlds and their inhabitants.'
