npc_arena_hero_stegius_bio: 'Master of Destruction, Master of Death ... There are many names for this demon, but they all say one thing: this monster destroys everything in its path. Once he was the Master of Desolus, the terrible and destructive world of the sixth Abyss, and his chief blacksmith, it was he who created the most terrible blade in the whole universe - the Stigian Desolator made of a thorn on the tail of Stegius, which the devil wrenched himself. Dezolator absorbed all the malice and hatred of its creator. Stegius destroyed many worlds, not sparing their inhabitants, in fact completely destroyed the 3rd and 4th dimensions. For this, the seal of Al-Galor was imposed on him, and now Stegius will never find peace. He will destroy and destroy. All and all. Until he is destroyed by his own fury.'
